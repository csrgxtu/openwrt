How to compile and write programe for TP-LINK WR720N
I have done this before just for testing, and I did not write the
thing up, so now I am kind of forgetten how to do the work exactly.
so, here I am gonna to do it again to show you how to play with
openwrt and how to program on it.

Prepare
  1, To programe or comiple openwrt you need a Linux operating system
with GCC and other tools installed, here I am using Ubuntu 12.04,
roughly all Linux distributions should work the same. but for
windows, It is way more complicated, so here dont use Windows
operating system.
  Ubuntu 12.04 X86_64
  sudo apt-get install build-essential subversion git-core
  libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk flex quilt libssl-dev xsltproc
  libxml-parser-perl
  sudo apt-get install g++ libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev bison flex 
  unzip autoconf gawk make gettext gcc binutils patch bzip2 libz-dev
  asciidoc subversion sphinxsearch libtool sphinx-common


  2, The upper paragraph tells you how to prepare the compile
environment, here you need to get the source code that supports
your router hardware, for example, my is TP-LINK WR720N, so I need
get the most recent source code that has built-in support for WR720N.
  svn checkout svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/

  3, Update and Install the feeds of the extra packeges into the
source code.
  ./scripts/feeds update -a
  ./scripts/feeds install -a

  4, Everything is ok, now compile the source code and generate the
route os and development SDK.
  make defconfig (this check the dependencies)
  make menuconfig (config to adapt to your hardware and chose the
  packeges you want)
  make -j 4 V=s (-j is jobs, if your CPU is 4 core, then -j 4 and
  V is verbose)
